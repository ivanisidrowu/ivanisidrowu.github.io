I'm a newbie programmer who work for a company in Taiwan. I want to write blog to record things I learned from work and improve writing skill. I've worked about two months. Most of the time, I code in JAVA. In very beginning of my job, I'm responsible for maintaining web service. One week later, I got into Android team. We focus on developing mobile APP on Android platform. Honestly, I love this job. I can learn new things everyday, and my professional skills are getting better and better. I hope writing this blog can let me review something I've learned.
