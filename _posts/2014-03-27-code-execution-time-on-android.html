When it comes to improving performance, code execution time becomes really important.<br />Is there any simple way to get code execution time on Android?<br />The answer is YES!<br />I didn't know this before doing some research online...<br />All you have to do is just new "TimingLogger"!<br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint lang-java">TimingLogger mTimingLogger = new TimingLogger(YOUR_TAG, "theMethod");<br /> // Code Part1<br />mTimingLogger.addSplit("CodePart1");<br />// Code Part2<br />mTimingLogger.addSplit("CodePart2");<br />mTimingLogger.dumpToLog();</pre><br />The execution time of code part 1 and part 2 will be printed on adb logcat.<br />However, before you print it, you have to set log level to VERBOSE.<br />So here is an example...<br />First of all, open your cmd command line, and cd to <typeyourandroidsdklocation>/platform-tool/ Then, type the following commands to set log level to VERBOSE. </typeyourandroidsdklocation><br /><pre class="prettyprint">adb shell setprop log.tag.plzTypeYourTagHere VERBOSE</pre>After finishing all steps above, you can run your application. Your log printing will be like this one... <br /><pre class="prettyprint">03-28 13:41:23.695: D/ivan(18099): theMethod: begin<br />03-28 13:41:23.695: D/ivan(18099): theMethod:      1 ms, codePart1<br />03-28 13:41:23.695: D/ivan(18099): theMethod:      3 ms, codePart2<br />03-28 13:41:23.695: D/ivan(18099): theMethod: end, 4 ms</pre>Use this method can let us know code execution time and try to improve the performance.<br /><div>BTW, if you are interested in how I print code on Blogger, you can reference this article...<a href="http://www.stylifyyourblog.com/2012/07/syntax-highlighting-in-blogger-using.html">&nbsp;http://www.stylifyyourblog.com/2012/07/syntax-highlighting-in-blogger-using.html</a></div>
