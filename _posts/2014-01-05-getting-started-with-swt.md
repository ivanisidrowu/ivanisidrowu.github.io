I was assigned a product's updating task, so basically I'm surveying SWT.

Although this is a new thing to me, I will try my best to accomplish it.

To be honest, I wanna keep developing APP...

Luckily, this task only will last about a month. 

After this GUI updating thing done, I can go back and develop APP. YAY~~~

Anyway, here's some websites can help people who wanna learn how to use SWT (included me lol).

This list will keep updating if I got new things noted.
