I"J<p>Since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1RVYt2QKQE&amp;t=682s">Google I/O 2017</a>, I think I should learn Kotlin because they announced that Kotlin has became one of the offical support languages in Android. So I want to introduce some of Kotlin features. Also, itâ€™s for me to recap how I learn Kotlin in short.</p>
